# Fetch Remote Server IP

This is a small console app that auto fetch IP of a remote PC then send it to your email address.

This is intended for people that frequently remote their PC from afar but their ISP constantly changing their public IP address. So instead checking manually by visiting IP checking websites, you can download this app, setup Windows Scheduler according to your needs, and bam! done.

## Notes
- This app uses **Gmail SMTP service**, so you need to authorize it first in your Gmail account.
- First time setup you need to enter your **email address** and your **application password** (can be found [here](https://myaccount.google.com/security), login to Google section, then application password)
- Don't forget to add the app to Windows Scheduler then set your time or it will not run automatically!
